Over 40 years’ experience in all aspects of operations, asset management, training, safety and regulation.  For the past 5 years has been leading ENWs highly successful innovation, automation and grid modernisation strategies.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">The advent of the huge rise in Low Carbon Technologies such as renewable generation, electric vehicles and large scale battery storage is already transforming how we run our business.  These technologies are in turn are driving digitisation of the electricity grid where we are investing in the latest automation technologies and unprecedented levels of grid monitoring and remote control.   These changes are just the start of the Net Zero challenges we face, my team and I are tasked with guiding ENW through this transformation setting out the commercial and technical strategies needed to ensure ENWL continues as the leading DNO.</p>
